# Module-1-challenge

## Description

This is the Horiseon webpage, given for the Module 1 challenge. 

## Modifications

After receiving the starter code, I:
Added accessibility elements within atl text for images.
Refactored the HTML to increase accessibility again by replacing the majority of div elements with semantic HTML elements like "< main >", "< body >", "< header >", "< footer >", and "< aside >".
Refactoring into semantic elements also created a logical flow of HTML to increase accessibility.
Reworked style.css to create a simplified verison of the CSS to also match the new HTML element names.
